this acts as the main landing page for 5 projects we did in the developement of a movie database project, with each project 1-5 being an iteration on the last project with improvements and features added. so project one would be the earliest version of the project and project 5 would be the final.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
script instructions:
the log parser.py is python 3.6 program. which when ran with a TimeLogs.txt in the same folder will return to you the average TS and TJ times in milliseconds. 

you can run it in aws with the command python3 log parser.py. 

you may need to install python 3.6 if you do not have it

to properly run the program, you must have ONE text file in the same folder called TimeLogs.txt, it must be called this (which is its default name when made in the projects folder under the tomcat/webapps), and be properly formatted in the way our program produces the file, or it will not work

you can find examples of theses file under project5/log info folder, where you will find several TimeLog.txt's with their names changed to indicate which test they are from, simply put them rename one of these files appropriately, put it in the same folder as the log parser.py, and it should run
